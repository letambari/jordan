                            <p>FX trading is the buying and selling of currencies with the aim of making a profit. Currencies are traded in pairs - the first currency listed in a forex pair is called the ‘base’ currency while the second currency is called the ‘quote’ currency.
                                The EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar) is the most traded currency pair in the world. The example below involves buying the Euro and selling the US dollar. In other words, the price represents the amount of US dollars that can be exchanged for one Euro.
